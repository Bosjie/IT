The time has finally come, I have started a blog!

WHY? Because I want to sharpen my IT skills and advance my career to the next level(s).
I will be diving into topics such as Cyber Security, (Web) Developing and maybe some others.
The goal is to continuously push myself forward, learning new concepts and/or strengthening existing ones.

In this blog I will post any relevant experiences along the way, serving as a portfolio of my journey.

So to start off, I created this website using some awesome (and free) technologies:

1. Create <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a> repository
2. Deploy repository to <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Github Pages</a> (uses <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> by default)
3. Clone a nice looking minimalistic theme (thanks <a href="https://mademistakes.com/work/jekyll-themes/minimal-mistakes/" target="_blank">Minimal Mistakes</a>)
4. Play around and edit the thing to my liking :)
