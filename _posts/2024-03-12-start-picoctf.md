I entered my first 'Capture The Flag' event at <a href="https://picoctf.org/" target="_blank">picoCTF</a> to see what CTF's are all about.
 
It was a lot of fun, and I learned about many different topics and tools in the process, like:
* priviledge escalation
* magic bytes
* forensics
* exiftool
* alternate data stream in Windows
* hex dump / hex editor
* disk analysis (image layers)
* sleuthkit (traverse layers)
* steganography 
* ...

I could solve all but one of the fundamental skills challenges.

The concept of CTF's is amazing and I'm looking forward to participate in future ones.
