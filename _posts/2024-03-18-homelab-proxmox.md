Instead of running a bunch of Virtualbox machines on my local machine, I decided to grab my old laptop (which is collecting dust) and use it as a home lab.
It's a low-powered one but it'll do the job:

Asus Zenbook UX305CA:
> Intel® Core™ m3-6Y30 2.20 GHz (2 cores - 4 threads)\
> 4GB RAM\
> 120GB SSD

My current installation:
1. Install <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-virtual-environment/overview" target="_blank">Proxmox VE</a>
2. Create <a href="https://ubuntu.com/server" target="_blank">Ubuntu Server</a> VM

So far it's running beautifully! I'll mess around with it and update this post when my setup changes.

I intend to set up different linux servers and do some Active Directory testing in the future.
