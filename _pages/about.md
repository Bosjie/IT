Hi there! :) 

I'm Tom, born and raised in Belgium and computer enthusiast by heart.

I can still remember playing MS-DOS games on a Windows 98 PC as a small kid, hearing the beautiful dial-up modem sounds every day, owning my first personal computer somewhere around age 15, then building my own custom one at age 16.

Along the way learned some HTML and CSS, set up some servers (file, ftp, gaming, website, etc), learned some linux (Arch Linux and Gentoo, because why not), probably created more than 1000 Virtualbox machines by now because that's just fun.

Got myself into trouble at school a few times because I spammed the whole network with cmd net send messages. Also scanned the schools network and found an Excel sheet with all teacher's diplomas in it (I did report it to the IT admin though). 

Worked as an administrative assistant for some time, then started travelling a bunch. Learned how to scuba dive, liked scuba diving, got certified as a PADI Rescue Diver. 

Ended up working as IT Support for IBM in Johannesburg, South Africa providing support for a Dutch bank in The Netherlands (300ms RDP anyone?). 

Developed some back issues (sad), got into yoga, back issues fixed (happy), liked yoga a lot, went to India and got certified as a Yoga Instructor.

Got myself a microdegree in Networking (CCNA: Introduction to networks) and Web Technology (html, css, javascript, node.js) at KdG, Antwerp and since then knew I wanted to pursue those fields.

So, I guess we're here now, in the present moment. Well, right now I have a purpose: expand my knowledge and skills and grow my career.
I have a big interest in Cyber Security and (Web) Developing.
And while learning, I'll keep track of it on this website :)

I consider myself minimalistic, hence the minimalistic theme.

In the future I might expand the blogging and document my travel/yoga/diving adventures as well, who knows, I'm not sure.
